## 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
>These are the files used for solving different tasks involving OOP in python.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark::
[tests](./tests): All main files used to test the functions are located in the tests folder, each file name is preceeded with the number of each task (i.e for task 0 the main file is [0-main.py](./tests/0-main.py)).
